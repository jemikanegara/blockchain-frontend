## NOTES

- I Use the demo API due to failed installation on astograph (error on yarn dev)
- No Subscription on Buy/Sell Best Price (I did follow the instruction on apollo website but still not work)
- No Market Depth Chart (I'm running out of time)
- No Market Depth Background Color on OrderBook (I have no idea about this)
- No Zooming on Market Depth and Orderbook
- No Volume Bar inside the candlestick and line chart (I tried using multiple series but it overlap the main series, maybe because of the demo data, so I decide to delete it)
- No Currency converter (I'm running out of time)
- No Switch base currency with the counter currency (I'm running out of time)
- No Interval Variation on the chart, I'm running out of time
- No Login / Register Pop Up

I'm sorry for the dirty code, I haven't write any react app with hooks before this.
